# Accessibility Checker

## Overview

The Accessibility Checker is a web-based tool developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to test websites and other HTML-based user interfaces for accessibility compliance. The checker utilizes a set of WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) rules to help identify common accessibility issues, such as ensuring that each page contains an `h1` heading and avoiding ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) "gotchas," like improperly used ARIA attributes that may be ignored by assistive technologies.
